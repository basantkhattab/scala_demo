/**
 * Animate extends SimpleSwingApplication which makes
 * Animate a Swing application 
 *
 * In buffer "allEffects" you can initiate new instances of
 * all the effects from the package s1.demo.effects
 *
 * In buffer "demo" please initiate in order the effects used in your
 * demo ( aka combination of effects ). Effects are changed when the
 * current effect returns true from its "next" method.
 * 
 * Music can be added by adding the path of the .wav file wrapped in Option.
 * If music is not required for the demo, you can simply give the demoMusic value None.
 * Music is only added for the demo as a whole, not to individual effects.
 * NOTE: Unfortunately, the current version doesn't support MP3 files. wav is recommended.
 *
 * It is also possible to change the delay for effects
 * -> change the speed how quickly things change. Feel free to
 * change this variable and play with it.
 *
 * The variable top declares the top variable needed for SimpleSwingApplication.
 * In order to build your own effects and demos you don't have to touch this variable.
